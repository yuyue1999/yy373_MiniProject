#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is intended to run in multiple environments;
#   otherwise, check in what you've tested to ensure reproducibility.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, if you're developing a library, you should probably ignore it since libraries should not lock dependencies.
